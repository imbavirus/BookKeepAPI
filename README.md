# BookKeep API

A .NET-based RESTful API for managing a book collection. This API provides functionality to store, retrieve, and manage book information, including integration with the OpenLibrary API for book cover images. This API is designed to work with [BookKeepWeb](https://github.com/imbavirus/BookKeepWeb), a modern web interface for managing your book collection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- .NET 9.0
- Entity Framework Core 9.0.5
- SQLite
- FluentValidation
- xUnit for testing
- Swagger/OpenAPI
- Moq for mocking in tests

## üìã Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- PowerShell 7.0 or later
- Git

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BookKeepAPI.git
cd BookKeepAPI
```

2. Set up the database by running Entity Framework migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project ./Application --startup-project ./API
```

For convenience, you can also use the provided PowerShell 7 script:
```powershell
./setup-database.ps1
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

Run the API using the .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet run --project ./API
```

For convenience, you can also use the provided PowerShell 7 script:
```powershell
./run.ps1
```

The API will be available at:
- HTTP: http://localhost:5001
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:5001/swagger

## üè≠ Building for Production

1. Build the application:
```bash
dotnet publish ./API -c Release -o ./publish
```

2. Configure production settings in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Cors": {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://your-production-frontend-domain.com"
    ]
  },
  "Endpoints": [
    "http://0.0.0.0:5001"
  ]
}
```

3. Set up your database:
```bash
cd ./publish
dotnet BookKeepAPI.API.dll --apply-migrations
```

4. Run in production:
```bash
dotnet BookKeepAPI.API.dll
```

For containerized deployment, you can use Docker:
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./publish .
EXPOSE 5001
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BookKeepAPI.API.dll"]
```

Build and run the container:
```bash
docker build -t bookkeep-api .
docker run -p 5001:5001 bookkeep-api
```

## üß™ Running Tests

Run tests using the .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet test
```

For convenience, you can also use the provided PowerShell 7 script:
```powershell
./run-tests.ps1
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Api/` - API controllers and middleware
- `Application/` - Core business logic, models, and data access
- `Tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `*.ps1` - PowerShell scripts for common operations

## üîÑ Database Migrations

Create a new migration using Entity Framework CLI:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add "YourMigrationName" --project ./Application --startup-project ./API
dotnet ef database update --project ./Application --startup-project ./API
```

For convenience, you can also use the provided PowerShell 7 script which combines these steps:
```powershell
./run-migrations.ps1 -MigrationName "YourMigrationName"
```

## üìù API Documentation

Once the application is running, visit http://localhost:5001/swagger to view the complete API documentation.

## üîí CORS Configuration

CORS is configured to allow requests from:
- http://localhost:5173
- http://127.0.0.1:5173
- https://bookkeep-web.home.infernos.co.za

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer** (`Api/`)
  - Controllers
  - Middleware
  - Services
  - API-specific configuration

- **Application Layer** (`Application/`)
  - Business Logic
  - Data Access
  - Models
  - Validation
  - External Service Integration

- **Test Layer** (`Tests/`)
  - Unit Tests
  - Integration Tests
  - Test Utilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

The API implements global exception handling through middleware that provides consistent error responses across all endpoints.

## üìö Models

All models inherit from `BaseModel` which includes:
- Unique identifier (Id)
- GUID
- Creation timestamp
- Last update timestamp
- Active status flag

### Book Model

The main entity in the system is the Book model, which includes:

Required fields:
- Title (max 200 characters)
- Author (max 100 characters)
- ISBN (10-13 characters)

Optional fields:
- Description (max 2000 characters)
- Publication Year (between 1000 and current year + 5)
- Genre (max 50 characters)
- Cover Image URL (max 500 characters)

Features:
- Automatic cover image fetching from OpenLibrary API using ISBN
- Validation for all fields including ISBN format
- Soft delete functionality
- Duplicate ISBN prevention
- Audit trail (creation and update timestamps)
